Hi! I'm Yatharth Singh (often known as _lefteryx_ on the internet), a Computer Science Engineering Freshman at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus.

I waste a lot of time on the internet and can follow instructions (which I've been told is the _Sigma Developer Grindset_).
Besides being a terminally online nerd, I like playing the Keyboard, playing Table tennis, Quizzing, watching Tarantino flicks, listening to that one playlist my mom made probably in 2013, admiring the colour blue, watching cat videos and playing CS:GO with Russians.

I'm currently exploring and learning Machine Learning, Back-end Development and Competitive Programming.

Reach me via email at _lft@duck.com_ or at [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/yath). 
I can also be found lurking on [Telegram](t.me/lftryx) (_@lftryx_) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lefteryx) (_@lefteryx_).

P.S. Most of the repos here have been transferred from @WellCrowKek, another account of mine that isn't active anymore.
