Hey! I'm Yatharth Singh (often known as _lefteryx_ on the internet), a Computer Science Engineering Sophomore at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus.

I waste a lot of time on the internet and can follow instructions (which I've been told is the _Sigma Developer Grindset_).
Besides being a terminally online nerd, I like playing the Keyboard, playing Table tennis, Quizzing, watching Tarantino flicks, listening to that one playlist my mom made probably in 2013, admiring the colour blue, watching cat videos and playing CS:GO with Russians.

I'm currently exploring and learning Deep Learning and Competitive Programming.
